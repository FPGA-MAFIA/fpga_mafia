<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "Sdram_RD_FIFO.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "Sdram_RD_FIFO.v".  The design "Sdram_RD_FIFO.v" has a depth of 512 words of 16 bits each. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
