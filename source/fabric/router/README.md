# Router

The router is a critical component of the fabric architecture, responsible for routing data between different tiles in the system. It ensures efficient communication and data transfer between various components of the fabric.

## Components

### Input Ports
The router has multiple input ports, each connected to a different tile or component in the fabric. These input ports receive data packets that need to be routed to their respective destinations.

### Output Ports
The router also has multiple output ports, each connected to a different tile or component in the fabric. These output ports send data packets to their respective destinations.

### Routing Logic
The routing logic is responsible for determining the optimal path for each data packet based on its destination address. It ensures that data packets are efficiently routed through the fabric, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

### Buffers
The router includes buffers to temporarily store data packets while they are being routed. These buffers help manage congestion and ensure smooth data flow through the fabric.

## Functionalities

### Data Routing
The primary functionality of the router is to route data packets between different tiles in the fabric. It uses the routing logic to determine the optimal path for each data packet and forwards it to the appropriate output port.

### Congestion Management
The router includes mechanisms for managing congestion in the fabric. It uses buffers to temporarily store data packets when there is congestion and ensures that data packets are forwarded as soon as possible.

### Error Handling
The router includes error handling mechanisms to detect and handle errors in data packets. It ensures that data packets are correctly routed and any errors are detected and corrected.

## Conclusion
The router is a critical component of the fabric architecture, responsible for efficient data routing and communication between different tiles in the system. It includes various components and functionalities to ensure smooth data flow and manage congestion in the fabric.
